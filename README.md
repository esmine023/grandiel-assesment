This is the culmination of module 2 of ETH + AVAX Assessment given the circumstances of Smart Contracts and its functionalities.

## Description
As per its name, Metamask Assessment is completed by giving ETH and depositing it. Using VS Code and Localhost, we managed to make and manage how we can access ETHs execute them through VS Code, and keep them running into a Browser. These functions such as npm and npx allow us to know how we can confine into Metamask and through the front-end and back-end beautifully.

# Getting Started

## Installing

Node.js and VSCode are the only ones you need to download, probably Chrome if you don't have one!
Then once done get the GitHub through chris' tutorial and edit the terminal there!

## Excecution

first off we need to do four things 

```
* npm install or npm i for nodes
* another terminal for npx hardhat node for executing all the available accounts 
* and another terminal for npx hardhat run --network localhost scripts/deploy.js to give the host 1 eth
* going back to the terminal where you installed the nodes, add npm run dev for finally accessing localhost/3000

```

Once accessed the Localhost/3000, install and add metamask first into your browser as an extension (check if you're connected to the account, if there's an error please go to the npx hardhat node to get the very first private key and access it through the extension and voila! an account with 10k ETH)

Then if you are done access the localhost/3000 to put your metamask onto the localhost and pick the metamask instead of phantom. 

The Delay might be slow but it'll work, if you're done with that do deposit ETH, confirm and voila! You're ready!
